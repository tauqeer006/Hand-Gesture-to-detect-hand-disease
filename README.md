Overview
This project aims to detect hand diseases by analyzing hand gestures using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image data and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) for numerical health-related data. The combination of both data types into a multimodal model allows for more accurate disease diagnosis based on a person’s hand gesture and their corresponding health information.

Goal
The goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate system that can detect early signs of hand diseases by combining image-based analysis (via hand gestures) with numerical health data (e.g., age, medical history). The system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a comprehensive tool for disease detection, particularly for conditions that manifest through physical gestures or movements of the hands.

Solution Approach
The project uses a multimodal approach, combining two neural network architectures—CNN for analyzing hand gesture images and FNN for interpreting numerical data (such as patient demographics and health parameters). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

Image Data Collection:

A dataset of hand gesture images is collected. These images capture different hand gestures, which can indicate symptoms of certain hand diseases (e.g., arthritis, tremors, etc.).
Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease or condition it represents.
Feature Extraction with CNN:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is used to automatically extract features from hand gesture images. The CNN architecture is designed to learn spatial hierarchies and detect patterns in the hand gestures, which are indicative of the type of hand disease.
The CNN model is trained on a labeled dataset of hand gestures and diseases, allowing it to classify gestures and detect disease-related patterns in new images.
Numerical Data Collection:

Alongside the images, additional numerical data is collected, such as patient age, gender, medical history, family history of diseases, and health metrics like joint pain level, flexibility, and motion range.
This data provides more context for diagnosis, helping to refine predictions made from gesture analysis.
Feature Analysis with FNN:

A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is used to analyze the numerical data. The FNN is trained to understand the relationships between the numerical inputs and the likelihood of a hand disease.
This model processes features such as age, medical history, and joint-related metrics to predict the probability of certain conditions.
Multimodal Model Fusion:

The CNN and FNN models are combined into a multimodal system. The outputs of both models (CNN for images and FNN for numerical data) are fused into a final prediction. This can be done by concatenating the feature vectors from both models and passing them through a fully connected layer for final classification.
The multimodal model produces a comprehensive diagnosis by combining both visual and numerical data, leading to more accurate and reliable disease detection.
Disease Diagnosis:

The system outputs a diagnosis, providing healthcare professionals with insights into the likely hand disease or condition based on the hand gesture and numerical data provided.
Web Application:

The multimodal model is integrated into a web application where users can upload images of their hand gestures and input their numerical data (such as age, medical history, etc.). The application will then process the data and display the diagnosis, along with recommendations for further action or medical consultation.
